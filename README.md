#NASA Astronomy Photo of the Day API and Rails
##Women Who Code DC
This is a demo app built to show how to incorporate the NASA APOD API into a Rails app, for Women Who Code DC.

To learn more about NASA's APOD API, [click here](https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#apod).

This is a great jumping off point. Other things you can do to improve the app include:
* Enable a "choose date" feature to view past photos
* Cache media in database
* "Jump to Random Date" photo generator
* Games?

The possibilities are endless!

Major credit goes to Barrett Clark, who concieved the idea of the app as a learning opportunity and helped with the [original build](https://github.com/barrettclark/nasa-apod).
